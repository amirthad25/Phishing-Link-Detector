🕵️‍♀️ Phishing Link Detector
A machine learning-based tool that detects phishing URLs by analyzing domain features and structural patterns. This project aims to enhance online safety by identifying potentially malicious websites before users interact with them.

📌 Features
🔎 Classifies URLs as Legitimate or Phishing

📊 Extracts key URL features like length, special characters, subdomains, etc.

🤖 Uses ML algorithms like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc.

📈 High accuracy and lightweight deployment

🌐 Can be integrated into browser extensions or security systems

🧠 Tech Stack
Python

Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy – ML and data processing

Flask / Streamlit – for UI (optional)

Jupyter Notebook – for training and evaluation

🚀 How It Works
Input: User enters or uploads a list of URLs.

Feature Extraction: URL features (e.g., length, special characters, presence of IP, etc.) are extracted.

Prediction: Trained ML model classifies the URL as Legitimate or Phishing.

Output: Risk label and probability score are shown.
